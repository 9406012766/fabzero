## Automatic Room Lighting System

Objective of the project:

1. The objective of this project is to make an Automated Room Lighting System which can automatically turn ON the lights by detecting the presence of human and turn OFF the light when no human presence is detected.

2. This project is useful since it aims towards conservation of energy which is most important.

3. The product would be useful in the those areas which require lights only when it is in use for eg: Staircase area, washrooms etc.

Components used in the project:

Micro-controller- At tiny-45 10 SU- 1no.
ISP Header – 1 no.
PIR Sensor – 1 no.
100 ohm resistor- 1 no.
10 K resistor- 1no.
LED- 1 no.
1 x 3 male Connector- 1no.
Solid State Relay- 1no.
