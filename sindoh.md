## Making a Object in "FreeCad"

Download and install "FreeCad".
Open FreeCad and click on File option click on "New".
Select "Part", click on "Box" mark, click on "Set to Axonometice View".

There are three axis like x,y, z.
Then click on "Model", click on "Cube" & put the lenght, height and width of the object.
Select again select another object like "Cylinder". Also put the lenght, height and width of the object.
Now, click on "Run a Boolean Operation" with two shapes selected".
To save the final image, click on "File", select "Export", select "STL.Mesh". This will save the file in ".stl" format.
