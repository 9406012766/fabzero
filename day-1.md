There are Small CNC Machine like SRM-2 (DG Shape) model. 
The Shopbot CNC machine is 3 axis machine. It's size is 96" x 48". It is used to fabricate preferably wood, alluminium. It's cutting length is 12".
The Saw cutter make WEN is the big hacksaw blade.
The Scroll saw cutter is the thin hacksaw blade and the material we may move any direction for perfact cutting.
The Band & Scroll Saw both are 3D cutter.
There is a High pressure water cleaner which is used to clean the materials cutting to remove the dust.
The Small CNC machine model SRM - 2 make DG Shape  is used for small thin materials preferably PCB. It is 3D cutting CNC machine.
There is Vinyl cutter model CAMM - 1, GS24, make Ronald. This is 2 axis machine. It is used to the vinyl materials. To cut the vinyl materials, the max. force i.e. weight on the machine is 80gm.
