It is also called Desktop Milling Machine.
With the SRM-20 3D milling machine, 3D data can be shaped into solid objects with exceptional precision. Capable of milling a wide range of materials, the SRM-20 is invaluable for industrial design prototypes, industrial parts, educational tools.
The SRM-20 portable milling machine can mill a broad range of materials, including modeling wax, chemical wood, foam, acrylic, poly acetate, ABS and PCB board. The following items are just some of the prototypes and applications made possible:

Product inventions
Wax molds for casting
Tools and machinery
Relief plaques and graphics Vehicle prototypes
Game and model parts.
