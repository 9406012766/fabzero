Stratasys develops and manufactures 3D printing technologies available today.
"PolyJet" is a 3D printing process that jets and cures thin layers of liquid photo polymer with UV energy. 
"PolyJet" is a powerful 3D printing technology that produces smooth, accurate parts, prototypes and tooling. With microscopic layer resolution and accuracy down to 0.1 mm.
It is capable of printing in 16-micron layers and in multiple durometers and many colors for multi-material parts. PolyJet is an excellent option for realistic, high-resolution models and prototypes.
